# Notedown

Notedown is a markdown derivative and set of tools specifically adapted for use with Knowledge Management (personal or otherwise). The goal of the project is to optimize for IDE/text editor and terminal based interaction with your notes. A markdown superset was chosen to allow for easy integration with existing markdown tools and to allow us to focus on the features that are unique to Notedown.

In this repo you will find the parser and a collection of workspace clients written in Go that can be used by cli tools or LSPs.
